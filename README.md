Grapedit
========

All programmers and web designers are working to some extent with text. Most of their time they spend on modifications of existing instead of writing new code. We can increase efficiency of this process when we enrich text by graphical elements. This can help code to be easier to navigate and also quicker to write. Our main goal is to introduce different way of text visualization and editing. We will analyze generation of text artifacts by grammar their way of visualization and their linkage with actual graphical elements on computer screen. All of this will be bundled in reusable component which we can use with modest extensions and changes with any structured text defined by grammar.
